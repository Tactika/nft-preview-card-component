## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project I was able to learned more about the background-blend-mode in CSS, which frustrated me starting off, but then became more understandible once I was able to mess around with it.

```css
#overlay:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  background-blend-mode: overlay;
}
```

### Continued development

I realized with this project that I could use more experience creating more streamlined CSS. I want to continue building more projects and honing my skills.
